          A: If you need to leave the picnic spot for any reason, please let us

        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: What happens if it rains on the day of my event?<br />
          A: Unfortunately, we cannot predict the weather. If it is raining on
          the day of your event, we recommend having a backup indoor location or
          rescheduling for a day with better weather.
        </p>
        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: What happens if I arrive late to my event?<br />
          A: Don't worry, we understand that things can come up and have a
          10-minute grace period before and after the event in case of any
          delays. If you are more than 25 minutes late, we may not be able to
          accommodate extra time. The designated end time for the event will not
          be pushed back. If you wish to add extra time to the event, it will be
          an additional cost.
        </p>
        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: What is your cancellation policy?<br />
          A: The deposit for your event is non-refundable, as we have secured
          the event spot and withheld it from other clients who may have wanted
          to book it.
        </p>
        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: How far in advance should I book my event?<br />
          A: We offer our services on a first come, first serve basis, and
          popular times tend to book up quickly. We recommend booking your event
          4-6 weeks in advance, especially for weekends. For weekdays, we
          recommend booking at least 3 weeks in advance.
        </p>
        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: What if my guest count changes?<br />
          A: We reserve items specifically for your event, and other items may
          be in use for other client bookings. It is important to know your
          minimum guest count to ensure that there is enough seating and space
          for everyone. If you need to add guests to your event, please let us
          know as soon as possible.

          are interested in adding food options to your event, please contact us
          for quotes.
        </p>
        <p class="secondaryFont w-full mb-5">
          Q: Can Luxe Picnics Toronto host events at any location?<br />
          A: While we can host events at many outdoor locations, we do have
          preferred parks that are more accessible. There are a few parks that
          we are unable to host events at due to high traffic, safety, and
          liability concerns. We always try to find a quiet and shady spot in
          the park for the most enjoyable picnic experience.
